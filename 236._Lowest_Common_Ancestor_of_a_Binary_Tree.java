/*236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree*/
/*

***Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree By Storing paths from root to n1 and root to n2: The idea of this approach is to store the path from the root to n1 and root to n2 in two separate data structures. Then look simultaneously into the values stored in the data structure, and look for the first mismatch.

***Illustration:
Path from root to 5 = { 1, 2, 5 }
Path from root to 6 = { 1, 3, 6 }

1.We start checking from 0 index. As both of the value matches( pathA[0] = pathB[0] ), we move to the next index.
2.pathA[1] not equals to pathB[1], thereâ€™s a mismatch so we consider the previous value. 
3.Therefore the LCA of (5,6) = 1

***Follow the steps below to solve the problem:

i.Find a path from the root to n1 and store it in a vector or array. 
ii.Find a path from the root to n2 and store it in another vector or array. 
iii.Traverse both paths till the values in arrays are the same. Return the common element just before the mismatch.
